# Korean Bioinformatics Club Project for multiple sclerosis (Open-Project)

* Current members: Kicheol Kim, Junhee Yoon
* Please, leave a message in **Discussions** tab if you have any question and requests

### Goal
* Finding potential biomarkers and therapeutic target for helping multiple sclerosis patients, **reference**: [Cell type-specific transcriptomics identifies neddylation as a novel therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33374005/)

### Phase 1
* Extracting significant signal from the dataset and finding Biomarker for **early detection** & **progression**
* Finding therapeutic target discovery based on biological dataset

### Phase 2
* Finding and developing actual business ideas or a practical usage case to make this project for helping patients
