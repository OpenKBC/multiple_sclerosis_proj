# KBC Multiple Sclerosis Project

* Purpose of this project is for helping multiple sclerosis patients by Bioinformatics technologies, and we are working for conquering muliple sclerosis. This project is desinged /managed by Korean Bioinformatics Club(KBC)
* Current members: Kicheol Kim, Junhee Yoon
* Please, leave a message in **Discussions** tab if you have any question and requests

### Goal
* Finding potential biomarkers and therapeutic target for helping multiple sclerosis patients, **reference**: [Cell type-specific transcriptomics identifies neddylation as a novel therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33374005/)

### Phase 1
* Biomarker for **early detection** & **progression**
* Therapeutic target discovery

### Phase 2
* Find or develop business ideas and skills to be an entrepreneur
